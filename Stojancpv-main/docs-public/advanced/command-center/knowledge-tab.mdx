The **Knowledge tab** is where you add information your agent can retrieve during conversations — product details, FAQs, policies, documentation, and more.

## How Knowledge Base Works

Your agent uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). When a caller asks a question, Vora searches your knowledge base for relevant content and injects it into the agent's context before generating a response.

This means your agent can answer questions accurately without memorizing everything — it looks up answers in real time.

## Adding Content

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple">
    Three ways to add knowledge:

    - **Upload a file**: PDF, Word, or text document
    - **Paste text**: Copy-paste any content directly
    - **Import from URL**: Vora crawls your website automatically
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced">
    Source types supported:
    - PDF documents (`.pdf`)
    - Word documents (`.docx`)
    - Plain text (`.txt`)
    - Web URLs (single page or full site crawl)
    - Direct text input
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Upload a Document

1. Click **Add Source** → **Document**
2. Select your file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT, max 50MB)
3. Vora processes and chunks the document automatically
4. Processing takes 30–120 seconds depending on file size

### Import from a URL

1. Click **Add Source** → **URL**
2. Enter your URL
3. Choose crawl depth:
   - **Single page**: Just the URL you entered
   - **Full site**: Follow links up to 3 levels deep (max 100 pages)
4. Click **Import**

Set up scheduled re-crawls to keep content fresh:
- Daily (for pages that change frequently)
- Weekly (for documentation or static pages)

### Paste Text

1. Click **Add Source** → **Text**
2. Give the source a name (e.g., "Pricing FAQ")
3. Paste your content
4. Click **Save**

## Managing Sources

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| View source details | Click the source name |
| Delete a source | Click the source → **Delete** |
| Re-process a source | Click the source → **Re-index** |
| Check processing status | Status badge shows: Pending, Processing, Ready, Error |

## Retrieval Settings

Configure how Vora retrieves knowledge during calls:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Relevance threshold** | Minimum similarity score (0–1) to include a chunk | 0.7 |
| **Max chunks** | Maximum knowledge chunks injected per turn | 3 |
| **Context budget** | Max tokens allocated to knowledge | 2,000 |

Higher relevance thresholds reduce noise but may miss relevant content. Start at 0.7 and adjust based on testing.

## Testing Your Knowledge Base

Use the **Test** button to search your knowledge base directly:

1. Enter a question a caller might ask
2. See which chunks would be retrieved
3. Review relevance scores
4. Adjust your content or settings if needed

## Best Practices

- **Be specific**: A focused knowledge base outperforms a broad one. Add only what's relevant to your agent's purpose.
- **Use clear headings**: Vora chunks by semantic boundaries — well-structured documents retrieve better.
- **Test with real questions**: Use actual questions customers ask, not hypothetical ones.
- **Keep content current**: Set up weekly re-crawls for documentation that changes regularly.
