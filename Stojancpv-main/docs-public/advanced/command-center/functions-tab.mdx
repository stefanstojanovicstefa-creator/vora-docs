# Functions Tab

The Functions tab lets you attach tool calls to your agent. Functions are actions the agent can execute during conversations - like booking appointments, checking order status, or transferring calls.

---

## How Functions Work

1. You define a function with a name, description, and parameters
2. During conversation, the LLM decides when to call the function
3. Vora executes the function and returns the result
4. The agent incorporates the result into its response

---

## Attaching Functions

In the Functions tab, you'll see:
- **Available functions** - Functions you've created or from templates
- **Attached functions** - Functions currently active on this agent

Click **Add Function** to browse available functions, or create a new one.

## Built-in Functions

Vora includes several built-in functions:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **transfer_call** | Transfer the caller to a human agent or phone number |
| **end_call** | Gracefully end the conversation |
| **book_appointment** | Schedule via Google Calendar integration |
| **send_email** | Send an email via connected email service |
| **lookup_crm** | Query connected CRM (HubSpot, etc.) |

## Custom Functions

Create your own functions for agent-specific actions. See the [Custom Functions](/advanced/custom-functions) guide for:
- Writing function code
- Defining parameter schemas
- Testing functions in isolation
- Using function templates

---

## Function Parameters

Each function defines parameters the LLM extracts from conversation:

```json
{
  "name": "check_order_status",
  "description": "Look up the status of a customer order",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "order_id": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The order ID to look up"
      }
    },
    "required": ["order_id"]
  }
}
```

The LLM extracts `order_id` from the conversation (e.g., "Can you check order #12345?") and passes it to the function.

## Testing Functions

Use the [Testing Tab](/advanced/command-center/testing-tab) to verify functions work correctly. During test calls, you'll see function calls logged in real-time with their inputs and outputs.
