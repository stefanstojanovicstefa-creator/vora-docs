title: Functions Tab
description: Connect your agent to external tools, APIs, and MCP servers from the Command Center
---

The **Functions tab** is where you give your agent the ability to take actions — look up data, send messages, create records, and interact with external systems.

## What You Can Connect

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple">
    Functions let your agent do more than just talk. You can connect to your existing tools or use built-in capabilities.

    **Common uses:**
    - Look up customer information during a call
    - Create a booking or reservation
    - Send a follow-up SMS or email
    - Check product availability
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced">
    Vora supports three function types:
    - **HTTP Functions**: Custom HTTP endpoints you control
    - **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol servers for rich integrations
    - **Built-in Templates**: Pre-built functions for common tasks
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Adding an HTTP Function

HTTP Functions call any endpoint you define when your agent needs to take action.

1. Click **Add Function** → **HTTP Function**
2. Enter a name (e.g., `check_availability`)
3. Enter your endpoint URL
4. Define the parameters your agent will collect from the caller
5. Map the response fields back to what your agent should say

**Example: Reservation check**
```json
{
  "name": "check_availability",
  "description": "Check if a table is available for a given date and party size",
  "parameters": {
    "date": { "type": "string", "description": "Date in YYYY-MM-DD format" },
    "party_size": { "type": "integer", "description": "Number of guests" }
  }
}
```

## Using the Function Wizard

The Function Wizard generates function schemas from plain English.

1. Click **Add Function** → **Function Wizard**
2. Describe what you want in plain English: _"Check if a product is in stock by SKU number"_
3. Vora generates the function schema automatically
4. Review and adjust, then save

## Connecting an MCP Server

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers give your agent access to rich integrations.

1. Click **Add Function** → **MCP Server**
2. Browse the MCP Catalog or enter a custom server URL
3. Authenticate the connection
4. Choose which tools to expose to your agent

See the [MCP documentation](/platform/integrations/index) for available integrations.

## Function Templates

Pre-built functions you can deploy in one click:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Send Email | Send a follow-up email after a call |
| Create CRM Lead | Add caller to your CRM as a lead |
| Calendar Booking | Book an appointment |
| SMS Notification | Send a text message confirmation |
| Order Lookup | Look up order status by ID |

## Testing Functions

Use **Test Function** to call your function with sample data before going live.

1. Select a function from the list
2. Click **Test**
3. Enter sample values for each parameter
4. Review the response and verify your agent will handle it correctly

## Troubleshooting

**Function not triggering**: Make sure your system prompt mentions the function by name or describes scenarios where it should be used.

**Timeout errors**: Functions must respond within 5 seconds. For slow operations, return an acknowledgment immediately and follow up asynchronously.

**Authentication errors**: Check your API keys and ensure your endpoint accepts the Authorization header format Vora sends.
