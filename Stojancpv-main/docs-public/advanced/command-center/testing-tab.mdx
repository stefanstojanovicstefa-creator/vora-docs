# Testing Tab

The Testing tab provides a built-in voice simulator to test your agent before deploying it live.

---

## Starting a Test Call

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Testing Tab">
    Navigate to your agent's Command Center and click the **Testing** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Allow Microphone Access">
    Click the microphone button. Your browser will prompt for microphone permission - click Allow.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Talking">
    Speak naturally. The agent responds in real-time using your configured STT, LLM, and TTS providers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-time Logs

During test calls, view live logs showing:

| Log Entry | What It Shows |
|-----------|--------------|
| **STT Transcript** | What the STT heard from you |
| **LLM Input** | Full prompt sent to the AI model |
| **LLM Output** | The model's response text |
| **TTS** | Voice generation status |
| **Function Calls** | Functions triggered, inputs, and outputs |
| **Latency** | Per-component timing in milliseconds |

## Testing Scenarios

Test these scenarios before deploying:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Happy path">
    Ask questions your agent should handle well. Verify responses are accurate and natural.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edge cases">
    Ask questions outside the agent's knowledge. The agent should respond honestly ("I don't have that information").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Function calls">
    Trigger function calls (e.g., "Book an appointment for tomorrow"). Verify the function executes correctly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interruption">
    Test barge-in by interrupting the agent mid-response. It should stop and listen to your new input.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Silence handling">
    Stay silent for a few seconds. The agent should prompt you (e.g., "Are you still there?").
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Test vs. Production

Test calls use the same providers and configuration as production. The only differences:
- Test calls are marked as test sessions in analytics
- Test calls are free (don't count toward usage limits)
- Test sessions have a 5-minute maximum duration

<Note>
  Changes to the Command Center take effect immediately in test calls. No need to redeploy to test configuration changes.
