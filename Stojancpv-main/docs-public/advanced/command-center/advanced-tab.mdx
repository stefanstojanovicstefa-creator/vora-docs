# Advanced Tab

The Advanced tab contains reliability and performance settings for production-grade agents.

---

## Provider Fallbacks

Configure backup providers that activate automatically if the primary provider fails.

| Component | Primary Example | Fallback Example |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| **STT** | Deepgram | Google Cloud STT |
| **LLM** | Gemini Flash | GPT-4o-mini |
| **TTS** | ElevenLabs | Cartesia |

When a primary provider returns an error or exceeds the latency threshold, Vora automatically switches to the fallback provider for the remainder of the session.

<Tip>
  Always configure fallbacks for production agents. Provider outages happen, and fallbacks keep your agent live.
</Tip>

## Circuit Breakers

Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by temporarily disabling unhealthy providers.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Failure threshold** | Errors before the circuit opens | 5 |
| **Recovery timeout** | Time before retrying the failed provider | 60 seconds |
| **Half-open requests** | Test requests during recovery | 1 |

When a circuit breaker trips:
1. The provider is marked as unhealthy
2. All requests route to the fallback provider
3. After the recovery timeout, a test request is sent
4. If successful, the primary provider is restored

---

## Timeouts

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **STT timeout** | Max wait for transcription | 5 seconds |
| **LLM timeout** | Max wait for AI response | 10 seconds |
| **TTS timeout** | Max wait for speech generation | 5 seconds |
| **Session timeout** | Max idle time before auto-disconnect | 300 seconds |

<Warning>
  Setting timeouts too low may cause premature failures during high-load periods. The defaults are tuned for a balance of responsiveness and reliability.
</Warning>

---

## Concurrent Sessions

Set the maximum number of simultaneous active sessions for this agent. Excess calls receive a busy signal or are queued.

---

## Retry Policy

Configure automatic retry behavior for transient failures:
- **Max retries** - Number of retry attempts (default: 2)
- **Retry delay** - Wait time between retries (default: 500ms)
- **Exponential backoff** - Increase delay on each retry (default: enabled)
