# Deploy Tab

The Deploy tab configures how users connect to your agent - phone numbers, web widgets, and SIP trunks.

---

## Greeting Message

Set the first message your agent says when a call connects:

```
Hi, thanks for calling Acme Corp! I'm Sarah, your virtual assistant. How can I help you today?
```

<Tip>
  Keep greetings under 2 sentences. Long greetings delay the caller's ability to ask their question.
</Tip>

## Deployment Channels

### Phone Numbers

Provision a phone number or connect your existing number:
- **New number** - Vora provisions a number for you (US, UK, and 40+ countries)
- **Port existing number** - Transfer your current number to Vora
- **SIP trunk** - Connect your PBX or telephony system

### Web Widget

Add a voice button to your website with a simple embed script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.voicevora.com/widget.js"></script>
<script>
  VoraWidget.init({
    agentId: "your-agent-id",
    position: "bottom-right",
    theme: "dark"
  });
</script>
```

Widget customization options:
- **Position** - bottom-right, bottom-left, or custom
- **Theme** - light, dark, or custom colors
- **Button text** - Customize the call-to-action
- **Auto-open** - Open widget automatically after a delay

### API

Create sessions programmatically via the REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.voicevora.com/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agentId": "your-agent-id"}'
```

See the [API Reference](/api/sessions/create) for full details.

## Webhook Configuration

Receive notifications for session events:

| Event | When It Fires |
|-------|--------------|
| `session.started` | A new call/session begins |
| `session.ended` | A call/session ends |
| `function.called` | A function is executed |
| `transfer.initiated` | Call transfer begins |

```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-server.com/vora-webhook",
  "events": ["session.started", "session.ended"]
}
```

- **Active** - Agent is live and accepting calls
