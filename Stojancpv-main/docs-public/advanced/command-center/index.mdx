## Overview

The Command Center organizes agent configuration into 9 tabs:

| Tab | Purpose |

| [Brain](/advanced/command-center/brain-tab) | LLM provider, model, system prompt, temperature |
| [Voice](/advanced/command-center/voice-tab) | TTS provider, voice selection, speed, fallback |
| [Ears](/advanced/command-center/ears-tab) | STT provider, language, voice activity detection |
| [Functions](/advanced/command-center/functions-tab) | Attach custom functions and tool calls |
| [Knowledge](/advanced/command-center/knowledge-tab) | Knowledge base, RAG configuration |
| [Advanced](/advanced/command-center/advanced-tab) | Fallbacks, circuit breakers, timeouts |
| [Deploy](/advanced/command-center/deploy-tab) | Phone numbers, web embed, SIP config |

## Accessing the Command Center

There are two ways to access the Command Center:

## Quick Configuration

For most use cases, you only need to configure three tabs:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Brain Tab">
    Choose your LLM provider and write (or paste) your system prompt. This defines what your agent knows and how it behaves.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voice Tab">
    Select a voice and TTS provider. Preview voices by clicking the play button next to each option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Tab">
    Set your greeting message and deployment channel (phone number or web widget).
  </Step>
</Steps>

The other tabs use sensible defaults that work well for most agents.
