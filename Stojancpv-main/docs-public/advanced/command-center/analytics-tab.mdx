The **Analytics tab** gives you visibility into how your agent is performing — call volume, success rates, sentiment trends, and cost breakdown.

## Overview Dashboard

The dashboard shows key metrics for the selected time range (last 7 days by default):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total calls** | Number of completed sessions |
| **Avg. duration** | Average call length in seconds |
| **Completion rate** | Calls that reached a successful resolution |
| **Avg. sentiment** | Mean sentiment score (positive/neutral/negative) |
| **Total cost** | Estimated cost across all calls |

## Call Volume

The call volume chart shows sessions over time. Use it to:
- Spot traffic patterns (peak hours, days)
- Identify sudden drops or spikes
- Track growth over time

## Sentiment Analysis

Vora analyzes sentiment at the segment level during each call.

**Sentiment scores:**
- **Positive** (>0.6): Caller is satisfied, engaged, or friendly
- **Neutral** (0.4–0.6): Informational exchange
- **Negative** (<0.4): Caller is frustrated or dissatisfied

**Using sentiment data:**
- High negative sentiment early in calls → your greeting may be off
- Sentiment drop at specific points → your agent may be struggling with certain topics
- Overall negative trends → consider retraining or updating your knowledge base

## Interruptions

Interruption events are logged when a caller speaks while the agent is speaking. High interruption rates indicate:
- Your agent talks too long before pausing
- Responses are not directly answering the caller's question
- Callers are impatient or confused

Reduce interruptions by:
- Shortening agent responses (adjust in the Advanced tab)
- Making sure the agent acknowledges the question before answering

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **LLM** | Tokens used for language model inference |
| **STT** | Audio seconds transcribed |
| **TTS** | Characters synthesized to speech |
| **Total** | Combined cost per call |
