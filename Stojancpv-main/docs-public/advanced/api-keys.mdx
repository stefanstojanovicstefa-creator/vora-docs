# API Keys

The API Keys page lets you manage your Vora API keys and configure your own provider credentials (BYOK - Bring Your Own Keys).

<Info>
  API Keys management is available in **Advanced Mode** only.

## Vora API Keys

Your Vora API key is used to authenticate API requests.

### Creating a Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to API Keys">
    Navigate to **API Keys** in the sidebar (Advanced Mode).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Key">
    Click **Create API Key**, give it a name, and set permissions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Key">
    Copy the key immediately - it won't be shown again.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Key Permissions

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| **Full Access** | All API operations |
| **Read Only** | Get agents, sessions, analytics |
| **Sessions Only** | Create and manage sessions |

### Key Rotation

Rotate keys regularly for security:
1. Create a new key
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Delete the old key

<Warning>
  Never expose API keys in client-side code. Use server-side API calls or Vora's web widget (which uses a separate embed token).
</Warning>

## Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)

Use your own provider API keys instead of Vora's shared keys:

| Provider | Key Name |
|----------|----------|
| **OpenAI** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Google** | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| **Anthropic** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **Deepgram** | `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` |
| **ElevenLabs** | `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` |
| **AssemblyAI** | `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` |

### Why Use BYOK?

- **Higher rate limits** - Your own API quotas instead of shared limits
- **Custom models** - Access fine-tuned or custom models on your account
- **Data privacy** - Requests go directly through your provider account
- **Cost control** - Pay providers directly at your negotiated rates

### Setting Up BYOK

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your provider key">
    Sign up with the provider and generate an API key from their dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Vora">
    Go to **API Keys** → **Provider Keys** and enter your key for the provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select in Command Center">
    In the Command Center, choose "Use my key" when selecting the provider.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Provider keys are encrypted at rest and never logged. You can revoke them at any time.
</Note>
