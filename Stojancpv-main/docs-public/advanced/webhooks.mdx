# Webhooks

Webhooks notify your server when events occur on the Vora platform. Use them to integrate with CRMs, trigger workflows, or log conversation data.

<Info>
  Webhooks are available in **Advanced Mode**. Configure them per-agent in the [Deploy Tab](/advanced/command-center/deploy-tab) or globally in Settings.

## Event Types

| Event | When It Fires |
|-------|--------------|
| `session.started` | A new call or chat session begins |
| `session.ended` | A session ends (caller hangup, agent hangup, timeout) |
| `session.transcript` | Full transcript available after session ends |
| `function.called` | A function was executed during conversation |
| `function.failed` | A function execution failed |
| `transfer.initiated` | Call transfer to human or number was triggered |
| `transfer.completed` | Call transfer was successful |
| `agent.deployed` | An agent was activated or updated |
| `agent.error` | An agent encountered a runtime error |

## Payload Format

All webhook payloads follow this structure:

```json
{
  "event": "session.ended",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-11T14:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "ses_abc123",
    "agentId": "agt_xyz789",
    "duration": 145,
    "status": "completed",
    "metadata": {
      "callerNumber": "+15551234567",
      "channel": "phone"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

### Signature Verification

Each webhook includes a signature header for verification:

```
X-Vora-Signature: sha256=abc123...
```

Verify the signature by computing HMAC-SHA256 of the payload body using your webhook secret:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  return `sha256=${expected}` === signature;
}
```

## Retry Policy

If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code, Vora retries:
- **Attempt 1** - Immediate
- **Attempt 2** - After 30 seconds
- **Attempt 3** - After 2 minutes
- **Attempt 4** - After 10 minutes
- **Attempt 5** - After 1 hour

After 5 failed attempts, the webhook is marked as failed. You can retry manually from the webhook logs.

## Webhook Logs

View delivery history in the webhook settings:
- **Status** - Success, Failed, Pending
- **Response code** - HTTP status from your server
- **Response time** - How long your server took to respond
- **Payload** - Full request body sent

<Tip>
  Use webhook logs to debug integration issues. Each failed delivery shows the error response from your server.
