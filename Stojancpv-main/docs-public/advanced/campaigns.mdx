## Creating a Campaign

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select an Agent">
    Choose which agent will make the calls. The agent's configuration (voice, LLM, functions) applies to all campaign calls.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Contacts">
    Upload a CSV with contact information:
    ```csv
    name,phone,custom_field
    John Smith,+15551234567,Order #12345
    Jane Doe,+15559876543,Appointment follow-up
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Schedule">
    Set when calls should be made:
    - **Start time** - When the campaign begins
    - **End time** - Daily cutoff time
    - **Timezone** - Respect contact timezone
    - **Max concurrent** - Simultaneous calls
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Greeting Override">
    Optionally customize the greeting per campaign:
    ```
    Hi {{name}}, this is Sarah calling from Acme Corp about {{custom_field}}.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Click **Start Campaign** to begin dialing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Campaign Analytics

Track campaign performance in real-time:
- **Calls made** - Total calls attempted
- **Connected** - Calls that were answered
- **Completed** - Calls that reached a successful outcome
- **No answer** - Calls that went to voicemail or weren't answered
- **Average duration** - Mean call length
- **Cost** - Total campaign cost

---

## Contact Variables

Use contact fields as variables in the agent's system prompt:
- `{{name}}` - Contact name from CSV
- `{{phone}}` - Contact phone number
- `{{custom_field}}` - Any custom column from your CSV

This personalizes each call based on the contact's information.

## Compliance

<Warning>
  Ensure your outbound campaigns comply with local regulations (TCPA in the US, GDPR in the EU, etc.). Vora does not provide legal advice - consult your compliance team.
</Warning>

Best practices:
- Only call contacts who have opted in
- Respect do-not-call lists
- Identify the call as automated at the start
- Provide an easy way to opt out
