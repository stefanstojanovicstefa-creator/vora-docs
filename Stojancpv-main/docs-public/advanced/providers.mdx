# Provider Selection

Vora's provider selection system lets you choose the best STT, TTS, and LLM providers for each agent. Configure primary providers, fallback chains, and automatic failover.

<Info>
  Provider selection is available in **Advanced Mode**. In Simple Mode, Vora uses optimized defaults.

## How Provider Selection Works

Each agent has a three-part voice pipeline:
1. **STT** (Speech-to-Text) - Converts caller audio to text
2. **LLM** (Language Model) - Generates intelligent responses
3. **TTS** (Text-to-Speech) - Converts response text to speech

You can independently configure each component per agent.

## Fallback Chains

Configure automatic failover for each pipeline component:

```
Primary: Deepgram → Fallback 1: Google STT → Fallback 2: Azure STT
```

When a provider fails, the next in the chain activates automatically. Configure fallbacks in the [Command Center Advanced Tab](/advanced/command-center/advanced-tab).

| **Quality-first** | Choose the highest quality provider regardless of cost |
| **Latency-first** | Prioritize the lowest-latency provider |
| **Cost-first** | Minimize per-session costs |
| **Balanced** | Vora's default, optimizing across all factors |

## Per-Language Providers

Different languages may work better with different providers. See the [Language Support](/languages) pages for per-language provider recommendations.
