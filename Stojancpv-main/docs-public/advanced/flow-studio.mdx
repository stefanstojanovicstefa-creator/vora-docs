# Flow Studio

Flow Studio is a visual editor for designing conversation flows. Build complex agent behaviors by connecting nodes on a canvas - no coding required for flow logic.

<Info>
  Flow Studio is available in **Advanced Mode** only.

## Overview

Flow Studio lets you design multi-step conversation flows visually:
- **Drag and drop** nodes onto the canvas
- **Connect** nodes to define conversation paths
- **Configure** each node's behavior, conditions, and responses
- **Test** flows directly from the editor

## Node Types

| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Start** | Entry point for the conversation |
| **Message** | Agent says a specific message |
| **Question** | Agent asks a question and waits for a response |
| **Condition** | Branch based on caller response or variables |
| **Function** | Execute a custom function |
| **Transfer** | Transfer to a human agent or phone number |
| **End** | End the conversation |

## Building a Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new flow">
    Go to **Flow Studio** in the sidebar and click **Create Flow**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Start node">
    Every flow begins with a Start node. This is added automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add conversation nodes">
    Drag nodes from the sidebar onto the canvas. Connect them by drawing lines between ports.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure conditions">
    Use Condition nodes to branch based on:
    - Keywords in the caller's response
    - Variables set by previous nodes
    - Function return values
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach to an agent">
    Link the flow to an agent in the Command Center's Advanced tab.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Flow

A simple appointment booking flow:

```
Start → Greeting → Ask for service type
  → [Haircut] → Ask for date → Book appointment → Confirm → End
  → [Consultation] → Ask for details → Transfer to specialist
  → [Other] → General response → End
```

---

## Variables

Flows can store and use variables throughout the conversation:
- **Built-in variables** - `caller_name`, `session_id`, `duration`
- **Custom variables** - Set by Question or Function nodes
- **Conditional logic** - Use variables in Condition nodes to branch flows

---

## Best Practices

- Keep flows simple - complex flows are hard to debug
- Test each branch independently
- Use fallback paths for unexpected responses
- Combine Flow Studio with Custom Functions for powerful automation
