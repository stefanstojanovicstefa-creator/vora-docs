# Your First Contribution

This guide walks you through making your first contribution to the Vora codebase, from finding an issue to getting your PR merged.

## Finding Your First Issue

### Good First Issues

Look for issues labeled with:
- `good first issue` - Simple, well-defined tasks
- `beginner friendly` - Extra documentation provided
- `documentation` - Docs improvements
- `bug` - Small bug fixes

### Where to Look

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh issue list --label "good first issue"

# Or visit:
# https://github.com/vora-ai/vora/labels/good%20first%20issue
```

### Example First Issues

| Type | Example | Complexity |
|------|---------|------------|
| Typo fix | "Fix typo in README" | Very Low |
| Docs | "Add JSDoc to AgentService" | Low |
| UI | "Add loading state to button" | Low |
| Bug | "Fix date formatting in logs" | Medium |
| Feature | "Add copy button to code blocks" | Medium |

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Claim the Issue

Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it:

```markdown
👋 Hi! I'd like to work on this issue. I'm a new contributor and this will be my first PR.
```

A maintainer will assign the issue to you.

### Step 2: Create a Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/fix-loading-state

# Branch naming conventions:
# - feature/description - New features
# - fix/description - Bug fixes
# - docs/description - Documentation
# - refactor/description - Code refactoring
```

### Step 3: Make Your Changes

#### Example: Adding a Loading State

Let's say the issue is: "Add loading state to the Save button in AgentForm"

```tsx
// Before: src/components/agents/AgentForm.tsx
<Button type="submit">
  Save Agent
</Button>

// After: src/components/agents/AgentForm.tsx
<Button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
  {isSubmitting ? (
    <>
      <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />
      Saving...
    </>
  ) : (
    'Save Agent'
  )}
</Button>
```

### Step 4: Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the relevant tests
npm run test

# Check types
npm run typecheck

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Test manually in the browser
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add src/components/agents/AgentForm.tsx

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat(agents): add loading state to save button

- Shows spinner while form is submitting
- Disables button to prevent double submission
- Updates button text to 'Saving...'

Closes #123"
```

#### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): short description

- Bullet point details
- What changed and why

Closes #issue-number
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation
- `style` - Formatting
- `refactor` - Code restructuring
- `test` - Adding tests
- `chore` - Maintenance

### Step 6: Push Your Branch

```bash
git push -u origin feature/fix-loading-state
```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request

Using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat(agents): add loading state to save button" --body "
## What

Added loading state to the Save button in AgentForm component.

## Why

Users were clicking the button multiple times, causing duplicate submissions.

## Changes

- Added spinner icon when submitting

- Updated button text to show loading state

## Testing

1. Open Agent creation form
2. Fill in required fields

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't

```tsx
// ❌ Don't include unrelated changes
// If you're fixing a button, don't also refactor other components

// ❌ Don't commit console.logs
console.log('debugging'); // Remove before committing

// ❌ Don't commit commented code
// const oldImplementation = ...

// ❌ Don't ignore TypeScript errors
// @ts-ignore
```

### Do

```tsx
// ✅ Keep changes focused on the issue

// ✅ Write clean, self-documenting code
const isFormSubmitting = formState.isSubmitting;

// ✅ Add helpful comments only when needed
// Using early return pattern for better readability
if (!user) return null;

// ✅ Follow existing patterns in the codebase
```

## Example Pull Request

Here's a complete example of a good first PR:

### Issue: Add confirmation dialog when deleting an agent

**Branch:** `feature/delete-confirmation-dialog`

**PR Title:** `feat(agents): add confirmation dialog for agent deletion`

**PR Description:**

```markdown
## What

Added a confirmation dialog that appears when users try to delete an agent.

## Why

Users were accidentally deleting agents with no way to undo. This adds
a safety check before permanent deletion.

## Changes

- Added `ConfirmDialog` component in `src/components/common/`
- Updated `AgentCard` to show dialog on delete click
- Added red "Delete" button styling for destructive actions

## Testing

1. Go to Agents page
2. Click delete button on any agent
3. Verify dialog appears with agent name
4. Click Cancel - verify nothing happens
5. Click Delete - verify agent is deleted

## Screenshots

### Before
[Screenshot of current delete behavior]

### After
[Screenshot of new confirmation dialog]

## Checklist

- [x] Tests added for ConfirmDialog component
- [x] Follows existing dialog patterns
- [x] Accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- [x] Works on mobile

Closes #456
```
