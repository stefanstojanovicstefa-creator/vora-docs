Connect Calendly so your agent can check availability and book meetings during a call.

## What It Does

- Checks your real-time availability during calls
- Books appointments directly into your Calendly calendar
- Sends confirmation emails to callers automatically

## Connect Calendly

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Click **Calendly** → **Connect**
3. Authorize Vora to access your Calendly account
4. Select which event types your agent can book

## How Booking Works

When a caller asks to schedule an appointment, your agent:
1. Checks your Calendly availability for the requested time
2. Proposes available slots
3. Confirms the caller's preferred time
4. Books the appointment via Calendly API
5. A confirmation email is sent automatically by Calendly

## Configuration

- **Event type**: Which Calendly event type to use for bookings
- **Buffer time**: Minimum notice required before a booking (inherits from Calendly)
- **Confirmation message**: What your agent says after booking
