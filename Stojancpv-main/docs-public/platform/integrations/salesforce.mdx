description: Sync Vora call data and leads directly to Salesforce
---

Connect Vora to Salesforce to automatically create leads, log call activities, and update contacts after every conversation.

## What Syncs

| Data | Direction | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| New leads | Vora → Salesforce | Callers identified as leads are created as Salesforce Leads |
| Call activity | Vora → Salesforce | Every session logged as a Salesforce Activity |
| Contact updates | Bidirectional | Phone numbers matched against existing contacts |

## Connect Salesforce

1. Go to **Settings** → **Integrations**
2. Click **Salesforce** → **Connect**
3. Log in with your Salesforce credentials
4. Grant Vora permission to read/write Leads, Contacts, and Activities
5. Choose your Salesforce instance (Production or Sandbox)

## Configuration

After connecting, configure how Vora maps data to Salesforce:

- **Lead source**: Set the lead source value for Vora-created leads (e.g., "Phone - AI Agent")
- **Activity type**: Set the activity type for call logs (e.g., "Call")
- **Duplicate handling**: What to do when a phone number matches an existing contact

## Troubleshooting

**Leads not appearing**: Check that your Salesforce user has Create permission on the Lead object.

**Duplicate contacts**: Enable the "Check existing contacts" setting to match by phone number before creating new records.
