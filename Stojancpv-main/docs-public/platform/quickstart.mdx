    ## Step 2: Configure Providers

    In the Command Center, configure your voice pipeline:

    | Component | Default Provider | Alternatives |
    |-----------|-----------------|--------------|
    | **STT** (Speech-to-Text) | Deepgram | Google, AssemblyAI |
    | **LLM** (AI Model) | Gemini Flash | GPT-4o, Claude, Groq, Mistral, Cohere |
    | **TTS** (Text-to-Speech) | ElevenLabs | Google |

    <Tip>
      Using Vora's default providers? No API keys needed - Vora handles the provider connections. Bring your own keys for custom providers via **Settings → API Keys**.
