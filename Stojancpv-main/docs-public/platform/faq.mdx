# Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What is Vora?">
    Vora is a platform for building voice AI agents. You create an agent, configure it with your business information, and deploy it to a phone number or your website. Callers speak naturally and your agent responds in real-time.

    No coding required for basic agents. Developers can unlock advanced features via the API, SDKs, and Command Center.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to know how to code?">
    No. You can create, configure, and deploy a fully functional voice agent without writing any code using the Interview or URL Import methods.

    If you want to build custom integrations, call external APIs, or embed Vora into your own app, coding knowledge helps — but it's not required to get started.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I create my first agent?">
    1. Sign up at [app.voicevora.com](https://app.voicevora.com)
    2. Click **Create Agent**
    3. Choose **Interview** — Vora asks you questions and builds your agent automatically
    4. Test it in the simulator, then click **Deploy**

    See the [Quickstart](/platform/quickstart) for step-by-step instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What languages does Vora support?">
    Vora supports 15+ languages including Arabic, Hindi, Bengali, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Malay, Thai, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, and English (Indian accent).

    Language support depends on which providers you use — see the [Language Support](/languages) section under Providers for per-language recommendations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What AI providers does Vora use?">
    Vora connects to best-in-class AI providers for each part of the voice pipeline:

    - **Speech-to-Text**: Deepgram (default), Google, AssemblyAI
    - **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs (default), Google
    - **Language Models**: Gemini Flash (default), OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, Cohere, and more

    You can use Vora's default providers with no setup, or bring your own API keys via **Settings → API Keys**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Simple and Advanced mode?">
    **Simple Mode** is for business users. It shows a clean interface with the essentials — create an agent, add knowledge, deploy to a phone number.

    **Advanced Mode** is for developers and power users. It unlocks the Command Center (full 9-tab configuration), custom functions, API access, provider selection, and monitoring.

    You can switch between modes at any time using the toggle in the dashboard sidebar. See [Simple & Advanced Modes](/getting-started/modes) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I add my own documents or website content?">
    Go to your agent's **Knowledge Base** tab and choose one of three methods:

    - **Upload a file** — PDF, DOCX, or TXT
    - **Import from URL** — Vora crawls the page and extracts content
    - **Paste text** — Add content directly

    Your agent will reference this content during conversations to answer questions accurately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I connect Vora to my CRM or calendar?">
    Yes. Vora integrates with HubSpot, Google Calendar, and supports webhook-based integrations for custom connections.

    Go to **Integrations** in your agent settings to connect external services. See [Integrations](/platform/integrations) for the full list.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I give my agent a phone number?">
    On your agent's deploy page, click **Phone Numbers** and either:
    - Request a number from Vora (provisioned automatically)
    - Connect your own number via SIP

    See [Phone Numbers](/platform/phone-numbers) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I embed a voice widget on my website?">
    Yes. After deploying your agent, go to **Deploy → Web Widget** to get an embed script. Add it to your website and a voice button appears for visitors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I review past conversations?">
    Go to **Sessions** in the dashboard to see all past conversations. For each session, you can view:
    - Full transcript with timestamps
    - Audio recording (if enabled)
    - Session duration and metadata
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does Vora cost?">
    Vora has a free tier to get started with no credit card required. Paid plans are based on usage (minutes of voice conversation).

    See [Billing & Plans](/platform/billing) for current pricing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use Vora's API to build custom integrations?">
