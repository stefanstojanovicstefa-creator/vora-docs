  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure call settings">
    Set voicemail, business hours, and overflow behavior.
  </Step>
</Steps>

See [Phone Numbers](/platform/phone-numbers) for detailed setup.

### API Integration

Start sessions programmatically:

```javascript
const session = await vora.sessions.create({
  agentId: 'agent_abc123',
  participant: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    phone: '+1234567890',
  },
  variables: {
    // Custom context
    account_id: 'acc_123',
    tier: 'premium',
  },
});

// Connect via WebRTC
const room = await vora.rooms.connect(session.roomUrl, session.token);
```

See [Sessions API](/api/sessions) for full documentation.

### Mobile SDK

Integrate voice into mobile apps:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="React Native">
    ```bash
    npm install @vora/react-native-sdk
    ```

    ```javascript
    import { VoraSession } from '@vora/react-native-sdk';

    function VoiceScreen() {
      return (
        <VoraSession
          agentId="agent_abc123"
          participant={{ name: 'User' }}
          onSessionEnd={(result) => console.log(result)}
        />
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="iOS (Swift)">
    ```swift
    import VoraSDK

    let session = try await Vora.createSession(
        agentId: "agent_abc123",
        participant: Participant(name: "User")
    )

    await session.connect()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Android (Kotlin)">
    ```kotlin
    val session = Vora.createSession(
        agentId = "agent_abc123",
        participant = Participant(name = "User")
    )

    session.connect()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

See [SDK Documentation](/sdk) for detailed guides.

## Production Configuration

### Recommended Settings

| Setting | Development | Production |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Recording** | Optional | Enabled (compliance) |
| **Logging** | Verbose | Standard |
| **Rate limiting** | Disabled | Enabled |
| **Webhooks** | Optional | Required |
| **Fallback** | None | Human transfer |

### High Availability

For production workloads:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automatic failover">
    Vora automatically fails over to backup providers if the primary is unavailable. Configure fallback providers in **Settings** → **Reliability**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Geographic distribution">
    Deploy agents in multiple regions for lower latency. Available on Enterprise plans.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Load balancing">
    For high-volume deployments, Vora automatically distributes calls across available capacity.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Security Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] API keys are stored securely (not in client-side code)
- [ ] Webhook endpoints use HTTPS
- [ ] Authentication is configured for protected actions
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Recording consent is handled appropriately

---

## Monitoring Your Deployment

### Real-time Dashboard

Monitor live calls in the dashboard:

1. Go to **Analytics** → **Live**
2. View active sessions, current callers, and agent status
3. Listen in to calls (if enabled)

### Alerts

Set up alerts for important events:

| Alert Type | Trigger | Action |
|------------|---------|--------|
| **Error rate** | >5% failures | Email + Slack |
| **Latency** | >2s response time | Slack |
| **Volume** | Unusual spike/drop | Email |
| **Escalation** | Transfer to human | Webhook |

Configure alerts in **Settings** → **Alerts**.

### Webhooks for Monitoring

Subscribe to events for external monitoring:

```javascript
// Example webhook payload
{
  "event": "session.completed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
    "duration": 245,
    "outcome": "resolved",
    "sentiment": "positive"
  }
}
```

See [Webhooks](/api/webhooks) for all available events.

---

## Rollout Strategies

### Gradual Rollout

Start with a subset of traffic:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with internal testing">
    Route only internal team calls to the agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Expand to pilot users">
    Select a small group of real customers for initial testing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Percentage rollout">
    Gradually increase the percentage of calls handled by the agent.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Full deployment">
    Once confident, route all eligible calls to the agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### A/B Testing in Production

Compare agent configurations:

1. Create two agent versions
2. Configure traffic split (e.g., 50/50)
3. Monitor metrics for each variant
4. Choose the winner based on data

See [Testing](/platform/agents/testing#ab-testing) for setup details.
