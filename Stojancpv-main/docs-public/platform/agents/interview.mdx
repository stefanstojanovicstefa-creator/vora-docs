## The Interview Process

Vora will ask you a series of questions to understand your needs:

### 1. Use Case Questions

<Accordion title="What will your agent do?">
  Describe the primary purpose of your agent.

  **Good answer:**
  > "Handle customer support calls for our software company. Answer questions about features, help with troubleshooting, and schedule demos with sales."

  **Too vague:**
  > "Help customers."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's your business?">
  Provide context about your company or organization.

  **Good answer:**
  > "We're a B2B SaaS company that sells project management software to small businesses."

  **Too vague:**
  > "We sell software."
</Accordion>

### 2. Personality Questions

<Accordion title="What tone should the agent have?">
  Describe the personality and communication style.

  **Options:**
  - Professional and formal
  - Friendly and casual
  - Empathetic and supportive
  - Efficient and direct
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Any specific phrases to use or avoid?">
  Specify language preferences.

  **Example:**
  > "Always say 'my pleasure' instead of 'no problem'. Never use jargon like 'synergy' or 'leverage'."
</Accordion>

### 3. Capability Questions

<Accordion title="What information does it need to answer?">
  Describe what knowledge the agent should have.

  **Example:**
  > "It needs to know our pricing plans, feature list, common troubleshooting steps, and company policies."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What actions should it take?">
  Describe what the agent should be able to do.

  **Example:**
  > "Look up order status, create support tickets, schedule callbacks, and transfer to a human when needed."
</Accordion>

### 4. Boundary Questions

<Accordion title="What should it NOT do?">
  Define limitations and restrictions.

  **Example:**
  > "Never provide refunds directly - always transfer to a human for refund requests. Don't discuss competitor products."
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should it escalate?">
  Define when to involve humans.

  **Example:**
  > "Escalate if the customer is frustrated, if it's a billing issue, or if it can't resolve the problem in 3 attempts."
</Accordion>

## Tips for Better Results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be specific">
    **Less effective:**
    > "Make it friendly"

    **More effective:**
    > "Use a warm, conversational tone. Address customers by their first name. Use phrases like 'I'd be happy to help with that!'"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Give examples">
    **Less effective:**
    > "Handle product questions"

    **More effective:**
    > "When asked about product X, explain that it includes features A, B, and C. When asked about pricing, offer the free trial first."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Define boundaries">
    **Less effective:**
    > "Be helpful"

    **More effective:**
    > "Help with support questions but don't provide legal advice, make promises about future features, or discuss competitor comparisons."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Describe your audience">
    **Less effective:**
    > "Talk to customers"

    **More effective:**
    > "Our customers are primarily small business owners who aren't very technical. Avoid jargon and explain things simply."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
