# Agents

Agents are the heart of Vora. Each agent is a voice AI assistant that can handle conversations, answer questions, and take actions on your behalf.

---

## What is an Agent?

A Vora agent is a voice AI that can:

- **Converse naturally** - Understands and responds to human speech in real-time
- **Answer questions** - Uses your knowledge base to provide accurate information
- **Take actions** - Executes functions like booking appointments or updating CRM records
- **Escalate** - Transfers to human agents when needed

```

1. **Draft** - Agent is created but not yet configured
2. **Testing** - Agent is configured and being tested in simulator
3. **Deployed** - Agent is live and handling calls
4. **Archived** - Agent is soft-deleted (recoverable for 30 days)

- **Speed** - Speech rate adjustment

### AI Model
- **LLM Provider** - OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.
- **Model** - GPT-4, Gemini Pro, Claude, etc.
- **Temperature** - Creativity vs consistency

### Knowledge Base (Optional)
Documents and websites that provide information for the agent to reference.

### Functions (Optional)
Custom actions the agent can take, like booking appointments or querying databases.

### Integrations (Optional)
Connected services like CRM, calendar, or messaging platforms.
