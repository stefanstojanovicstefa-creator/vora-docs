## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use clear, complete content">
    Write content that stands alone. Include context that helps the agent understand when to use this information.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Structure for retrieval">
    Use headings and Q&A format. This helps the chunking algorithm and improves retrieval accuracy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep entries focused">
    One topic per entry is better than mixing multiple topics. This improves retrieval precision.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent formatting">
    Adopt a consistent style across all text entries. This makes content easier to maintain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add expiration dates for temporary content">
    For seasonal or temporary information, add expiration metadata and review regularly.
  </Accordion>
