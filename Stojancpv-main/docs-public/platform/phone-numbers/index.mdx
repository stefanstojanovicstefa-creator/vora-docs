## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose the right number type">
    - **Local**: For regional businesses wanting local presence
    - **Toll-Free**: For national reach, customer perception of legitimacy
    - **Mobile**: When SMS capability is essential
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set up business hours">
    Configure after-hours handling to avoid missed opportunities:
    - Voicemail with callback option
    - Text message with business hours
    - Emergency escalation path
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor call quality">
    Regularly check MOS scores and network metrics. Poor quality degrades user experience.
