| Type | Prefix | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|
| Live | `sk_live_` | Production applications |
| Test | `sk_test_` | Development and testing |

<Warning>
  Test keys only work with test-mode sessions. Never use test keys in production.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Never hardcode API keys in your source code:

    ```bash
    # .env file
    VORA_API_KEY=sk_live_your_key_here
    ```

    ```javascript
    // Access in code
    const apiKey = process.env.VORA_API_KEY;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Create new keys periodically and deprecate old ones. This limits exposure if a key is compromised.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use separate keys per environment">
    Create different keys for development, staging, and production. This makes it easier to revoke access without affecting other environments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit key permissions">
    When available, create keys with only the permissions they need (principle of least privilege).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised or no longer needed:

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click **Revoke** → Confirm

<Note>
  Revoking a key immediately invalidates it. Any applications using that key will stop working.
</Note>
