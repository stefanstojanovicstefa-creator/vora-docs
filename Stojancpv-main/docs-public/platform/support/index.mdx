## Best Practices for Getting Help

### Provide Context

Good support requests include:

```markdown
**Issue**: Agent stops responding mid-conversation

**Account**: user@company.com
**Agent ID**: agent_abc123
**Session ID**: sess_xyz789

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Start voice session
2. Ask "What's my order status?"
3. Agent responds, then goes silent

**Expected**: Agent continues conversation
**Actual**: 10-second silence, then disconnect

**When it started**: January 15, 2024
**Frequency**: 3 out of 10 calls

**Attachments**: [session recording attached]
```

### What to Include

| Element | Why It Helps |
|---------|--------------|
| **IDs** | We can look up exact logs |
| **Timestamps** | Narrow down in our systems |
| **Steps** | We can reproduce |
| **Screenshots** | Visual context |
| **Recordings** | Hear exactly what happened |

### What to Avoid

- ❌ "It's broken" (too vague)
