## Agent Issues

### Agent Not Responding

**Symptoms**: Agent doesn't reply, long silences, session hangs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check agent status">
    1. Go to **Agents** → Select your agent
    2. Verify status is **Active**
    3. Check for any error messages

    If status shows errors, check the agent logs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review LLM configuration">
    Ensure the LLM is properly configured:

    1. Go to **Agent** → **Configuration** → **LLM**
    2. Verify a model is selected
    3. Test with a simpler model if issues persist

    ```javascript
    // Try fallback to faster model
    {
      "model": "gemini-1.5-flash",  // vs gemini-1.5-pro
      "timeout": 10000
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check for infinite loops">
    Your prompt might be causing the agent to loop:

    - Look for contradictory instructions
    - Simplify the system prompt
    - Add explicit termination conditions

    Bad:
    ```
    Always ask follow-up questions.
    Never ask more than 2 questions.
    ```

    Good:
    ```
    Ask up to 2 clarifying questions if needed.
    ```
  </Accordion>
