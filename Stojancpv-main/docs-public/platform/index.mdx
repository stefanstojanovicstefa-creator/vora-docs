## Platform Architecture

Vora's voice AI platform consists of several key components:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph User["Your Users"]
        Phone[Phone Call]
        Web[Web Widget]
        App[Mobile App]
    end

    subgraph Vora["Vora Platform"]
        Agent[Voice Agent]
        STT[Speech-to-Text]
        LLM[AI Model]
        TTS[Text-to-Speech]
        KB[Knowledge Base]
        INT[Integrations]
    end

    Phone --> Agent
    Web --> Agent
    App --> Agent

    Agent --> STT
    STT --> LLM
    LLM --> TTS
    TTS --> Agent

    LLM --> KB
    LLM --> INT
```

1. **Voice Input** - Callers connect via phone, web widget, or mobile app
2. **Speech-to-Text** - Audio is transcribed in real-time using providers like Deepgram
3. **AI Model** - The transcript is processed by LLMs like GPT-4 or Gemini
4. **Knowledge Base** - RAG retrieval augments responses with your documents
5. **Integrations** - External systems are queried or updated as needed
6. **Text-to-Speech** - Responses are converted to natural speech using ElevenLabs or Cartesia
