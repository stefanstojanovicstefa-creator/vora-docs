## Minute Calculation

### What Counts as a Minute?

Billing is based on **voice session duration**:

- Inbound phone calls
- Outbound phone calls
- Web widget voice sessions
- API voice sessions

### What Doesn't Count?

- Text chat sessions
- API calls (non-voice)
- Dashboard usage
- Testing in sandbox mode

### Rounding

- Sessions are rounded up to the nearest second
- Billed in 1-second increments
- Minimum session: 1 second

### Example

```
Session 1: 2:34 = 154 seconds
Session 2: 0:45 = 45 seconds
Session 3: 5:12 = 312 seconds
─────────────────────────────────
Total: 511 seconds = 8.52 minutes
```
