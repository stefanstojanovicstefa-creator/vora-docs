# Simple & Advanced Modes

Vora's dashboard and documentation offer two modes so you always see the right level of detail for your needs.

---

## How It Works

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple">
    **Simple Mode** is the default experience. It's designed for business users who want to create and manage voice agents without worrying about technical details.

    In Simple Mode, you'll see:
    - A streamlined agent creation flow (Interview and URL Import methods)
    - Essential settings only (voice, language, greeting)
    - Clean dashboard with key metrics
    - Guided workflows with helpful tips

    <Tip>
      Simple Mode is perfect if you want to get an agent up and running quickly. You can always switch to Advanced Mode later.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced">
    **Advanced Mode** unlocks the full power of the Vora platform. It's designed for developers and power users who need granular control.

    In Advanced Mode, you get everything in Simple Mode plus:
    - **Command Center** - 9-tab agent builder with full provider control
    - **Prompt Mode** - Direct system prompt editing
    - **Custom Functions** - Build and attach custom tool calls
    - **Monitoring** - Real-time system health and metrics
    - **API Keys** - Manage API keys and bring your own provider keys
    - **Provider Selection** - Choose and configure STT, TTS, and LLM providers

    <Info>
      Advanced Mode shows all configuration options. Some features like Custom Functions and Monitoring are only visible in Advanced Mode.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Switching Modes

### In the Dashboard

Click the mode toggle in the top-right corner of the sidebar. The toggle shows:
- **Simple** (sparkles icon) - Simplified interface
- **Advanced** (settings icon) - Full developer interface

Your preference is saved automatically and persists across sessions.

### In the Documentation

Throughout these docs, you'll see **Simple** and **Advanced** tabs on pages where content differs between modes. Click the tab that matches your experience level.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple">
    You're reading the **Simple** view. This shows you the essentials - what you need to know to use Vora effectively.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Advanced">
    You're reading the **Advanced** view. This includes technical details, API examples, provider configuration, and developer-focused content.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## What's Hidden in Simple Mode?

These dashboard sections are only visible in Advanced Mode:

| Feature | Why It's Advanced-Only |
|---------|----------------------|
| Command Center | Full 9-tab agent builder with provider config |
| Custom Functions | Requires coding knowledge |
| Monitoring | System-level metrics for developers |
| API Keys | Developer credential management |
| Provider Settings | Technical provider configuration |

<Note>
  Hiding these features in Simple Mode doesn't limit functionality - agents created in Simple Mode use Vora's optimized defaults for providers, models, and settings.
</Note>
