## Iteration 1 - US-001: Add vertical gap to VirtualGrid virtualizer
- **File**: ventus-voice/frontend/src/components/ui/virtual-list.tsx
- **Change**: Added `gap` property to VirtualGrid's `useVirtualizer` config (line ~242)
- **Problem**: VirtualGrid passed `gap` to CSS grid for horizontal spacing but NOT to the virtualizer for vertical row spacing, causing rows to touch
- **Fix**: Added `gap,` to the useVirtualizer options object, matching how VirtualList already does it
- **Typecheck**: PASSES
- **Status**: COMPLETE

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Normalize card height with consistent content
- **File**: ventus-voice/frontend/src/pages/AgentsPage.tsx
- **Change**: Replaced conditional `{agent.lastDeployedAt && (...)}` block (lines ~450-457) with always-present deployed row
- **Problem**: When `lastDeployedAt` was null/undefined, the entire deployed row disappeared, causing cards to have different heights
- **Fix**: Always render the "Deployed" label row. Show formatted date in Badge when available, show "Not yet deployed" in muted text when absent
- **Verified**: Card already has `h-full flex flex-col`, CardContent has `mt-auto` — structure was correct, just needed consistent content
- **Typecheck**: PASSES
- **Status**: COMPLETE
