## Iteration 1 - US-001: Add auth guard to tutorial state query
- Added `useAuth` import from `@clerk/clerk-react` to useTutorial.ts
- Destructured `isSignedIn` from `useAuth()` inside the hook
- Added `enabled: !!isSignedIn` to the useQuery options
- Query now only fires when user is authenticated (not on public routes)
- Typecheck passes ✅
