## Iteration 1 - US-001: Add auth guard to tutorial state query
- Added `useAuth` import from `@clerk/clerk-react` to useTutorial.ts
- Destructured `isSignedIn` from `useAuth()` inside the hook
- Added `enabled: !!isSignedIn` to the useQuery options
- Query now only fires when user is authenticated (not on public routes)
- Typecheck passes ✅

## Iteration 2 - US-002: Add tutorial validation events to agent creation flows
- Added `tutorial:validation` CustomEvent dispatch with `key: 'agent_created'` in InterviewBot.tsx handleOverlayComplete (after toast.success, before navigate)
- Added same dispatch in EnhancedAgentWizard.tsx handleDeploy (after toast.success, before navigate)
- TutorialSystem.tsx not modified (listener already correct)
- Typecheck passes ✅
