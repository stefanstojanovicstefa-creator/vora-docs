# Ears Tab

The Ears tab controls how your agent listens - the STT provider, language recognition, and voice activity detection settings.

---

## STT Provider

Choose which speech-to-text provider transcribes caller audio.

| Provider | Strength | Languages | Latency |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Deepgram** | Best overall accuracy | 30+ languages | Very low |
| **Google Cloud STT** | Wide language coverage | 100+ languages | Low |
| **AssemblyAI** | Strong English accuracy | 10+ languages | Low |
| **Soniox** | Real-time streaming | 30+ languages | Very low |
| **Azure Speech** | Enterprise, custom models | 80+ languages | Low |

<Tip>
  **Recommended default**: Deepgram for English and major languages. Google Cloud STT for rare languages or maximum language coverage.
</Tip>

## Language

Select the primary language for speech recognition. Options include:
- **Auto-detect** - The STT provider detects the language automatically
- **Specific language** - Lock to a single language for better accuracy

<Note>
  Auto-detection works well for multilingual agents but may add slight latency. For single-language agents, specifying the language improves accuracy and speed.
</Note>

See the [Language Support](/languages) page for per-language provider availability.

## Voice Activity Detection (VAD)

VAD determines when the caller is speaking vs. silent. This affects turn-taking behavior.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sensitivity** | How sensitive the detection is to speech (higher = picks up quieter speech) |
| **Silence timeout** | How long to wait after silence before the agent responds |
| **Prefix padding** | Audio buffer before detected speech start |

**Recommended settings:**
- Sensitivity: **Medium** (default)
- Silence timeout: **800ms** for natural conversations, **400ms** for quick Q&A
- Prefix padding: **300ms** to avoid cutting off the start of speech

---

## Barge-in

Barge-in allows callers to interrupt the agent mid-response. When enabled:
- The agent stops speaking when the caller starts talking
- The new input is processed immediately
- Creates a more natural, conversational feel

<Warning>
  Disabling barge-in means the caller must wait for the agent to finish before their input is recognized. Only disable this for specific use cases like automated announcements.
</Warning>
