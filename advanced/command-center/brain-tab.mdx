# Brain Tab

The Brain tab controls the AI model that powers your agent's intelligence - what it knows, how it thinks, and how it responds.

---

## LLM Provider

Choose which AI model provider processes your agent's conversations.

| Provider | Models | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Google Gemini** | Flash 2.0, Pro 1.5 | Low latency, multilingual, cost-effective |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini | Versatile, strong reasoning |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Nuanced conversations, long context |
| **Groq** | Llama 3, Mixtral | Ultra-low latency |
| **Mistral** | Mistral Large, Medium | European hosting, multilingual |

<Tip>
  **Recommended default**: Gemini Flash 2.0 offers the best balance of speed, quality, and cost for voice agents. Switch to GPT-4o or Claude for complex reasoning tasks.

## System Prompt

The system prompt defines your agent's personality, knowledge, and rules. Write clear instructions for how the agent should behave.

**Good system prompt structure:**
1. **Role** - Who the agent is (e.g., "You are Sarah, a customer support agent for Acme Corp")
2. **Context** - Business information and domain knowledge
3. **Rules** - What the agent should and shouldn't do
4. **Tone** - How the agent should sound (friendly, professional, casual)
5. **Escalation** - When to transfer to a human

```
You are Sarah, a friendly customer support agent for Acme Corp.

## About Acme Corp
Acme Corp sells premium widgets. Our hours are 9 AM - 5 PM EST, Monday through Friday.

## Rules
- Always be helpful and professional
- If you don't know the answer, say so honestly
- Never make up information about products or pricing
- Transfer to a human agent if the customer is upset or has a billing issue

## Tone
Speak in a warm, conversational tone. Use simple language. Keep responses concise for voice delivery.

## Temperature

Controls how creative or predictable the agent's responses are.

| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **0.0 - 0.3** | Highly predictable, consistent responses |
| **0.4 - 0.7** | Balanced (recommended for most agents) |
| **0.8 - 1.0** | More creative, varied responses |

<Note>
  For customer support and business agents, keep temperature between **0.3 - 0.5**. Higher values can lead to inconsistent or off-topic responses.
</Note>

---

## Max Tokens

Set the maximum length of the agent's responses. For voice agents, shorter is usually better:
- **150-300 tokens** - Concise voice responses (recommended)
- **300-500 tokens** - Detailed explanations when needed
- **500+** - Long-form responses (not ideal for voice)

---

## Conversation History

Configure how much conversation context the agent retains:
- **Messages to keep** - Number of recent messages in context
- **Summary generation** - Automatically summarize older messages to save context space
