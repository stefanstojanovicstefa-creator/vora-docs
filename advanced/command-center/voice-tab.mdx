# Voice Tab

The Voice tab controls how your agent sounds - the voice it speaks with, the TTS provider, speed, and fallback options.

---

## TTS Provider

Choose which text-to-speech provider generates your agent's voice.

| Provider | Voices | Best For |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **ElevenLabs** | 100+ premium voices | Natural, expressive speech |
| **Cartesia** | Sonic voices | Ultra-low latency, multilingual |
| **Google Cloud TTS** | 200+ voices | Wide language coverage, cost-effective |
| **Azure TTS** | 300+ voices | Enterprise, custom neural voices |
| **PlayHT** | Premium voices | Voice cloning, custom voices |

<Tip>
  **Recommended default**: ElevenLabs for English agents, Cartesia for multilingual or latency-sensitive deployments.
</Tip>

## Voice Selection

Browse and preview available voices for your selected provider. Each voice has:
- **Name** - Voice identifier
- **Language** - Supported languages
- **Gender** - Male, Female, or Neutral
- **Preview** - Click play to hear a sample

Click the play button next to any voice to preview it before selecting.

---

## Speed

Adjust the speaking speed of your agent:
- **0.8x** - Slower, deliberate speech
- **1.0x** - Normal speed (default)
- **1.2x** - Slightly faster, energetic
- **1.5x** - Fast delivery

<Note>
  Speed adjustments may affect voice quality depending on the provider. Test with your selected voice before deploying.
</Note>

## Fallback Voice

Configure a backup voice that activates if the primary TTS provider is unavailable:
- **Fallback provider** - A different TTS provider (e.g., Google as backup for ElevenLabs)
- **Fallback voice** - The voice to use from the fallback provider

This ensures your agent stays live even during provider outages.

---

## Language

Select the primary language for TTS output. This should match your agent's conversation language.

For multilingual agents, the TTS provider will attempt to match the detected language. See the [Language Support](/languages) page for per-language provider availability.
