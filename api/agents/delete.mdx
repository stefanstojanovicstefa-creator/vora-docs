# Delete Agent

Delete an agent from your organization. This performs a **soft delete** — the agent is marked as deleted but can be recovered within 30 days.

<Warning>
  Deleting a deployed agent will immediately stop it from receiving new calls. Any active calls will complete, but no new sessions can be started.
</Warning>

## Request

```
DELETE https://api.voicevora.com/v1/agents/:id
```

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |

| `id` | string | The agent ID to delete |

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |

## Examples

### Soft Delete (Recoverable)

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const result = await vora.agents.delete('agent_abc123xyz');

console.log(`Agent deleted at: ${result.deleted_at}`);
console.log(`Recoverable until: ${result.recoverable_until}`);
```

```python Python
result = vora.agents.delete('agent_abc123xyz')

print(f"Agent deleted at: {result.deleted_at}")
print(f"Recoverable until: {result.recoverable_until}")
```

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE https://api.voicevora.com/v1/agents/agent_abc123xyz \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Permanent Delete

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const result = await vora.agents.delete('agent_abc123xyz', {
  permanent: true
});

console.log('Agent permanently deleted');
```

```python Python
result = vora.agents.delete('agent_abc123xyz', permanent=True)
print('Agent permanently deleted')
```

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://api.voicevora.com/v1/agents/agent_abc123xyz?permanent=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Delete Multiple Agents

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const agentIds = ['agent_abc123', 'agent_def456', 'agent_ghi789'];

const results = await Promise.all(
  agentIds.map(id => vora.agents.delete(id))
);

console.log(`Deleted ${results.length} agents`);
```

```python Python
agent_ids = ['agent_abc123', 'agent_def456', 'agent_ghi789']

for agent_id in agent_ids:
    vora.agents.delete(agent_id)

print(f"Deleted {len(agent_ids)} agents")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Recovering Deleted Agents

Soft-deleted agents can be recovered within 30 days using the restore endpoint:

```
POST https://api.voicevora.com/v1/agents/:id/restore
```

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
// Restore a deleted agent
const agent = await vora.agents.restore('agent_abc123xyz');

console.log(`Agent restored: ${agent.name}`);
console.log(`Status: ${agent.status}`); // Returns to 'draft'
```

```python Python
# Restore a deleted agent
agent = vora.agents.restore('agent_abc123xyz')

print(f"Agent restored: {agent.name}")
print(f"Status: {agent.status}")  # Returns to 'draft'
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.voicevora.com/v1/agents/agent_abc123xyz/restore \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Restored agents return to `draft` status and must be redeployed.
</Note>

## Listing Deleted Agents

To see agents pending permanent deletion:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript JavaScript
const { data: deletedAgents } = await vora.agents.list({
  status: 'deleted'
});

deletedAgents.forEach(agent => {
  console.log(`${agent.name} - recoverable until ${agent.recoverable_until}`);
});
```

```python Python
deleted = vora.agents.list(status='deleted')

for agent in deleted.data:
    print(f"{agent.name} - recoverable until {agent.recoverable_until}")
```

```bash cURL
curl "https://api.voicevora.com/v1/agents?status=deleted" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
</CodeGroup>

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete an agent:

| Resource | Soft Delete | Permanent Delete |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Agent configuration | Preserved (30 days) | Removed |
| Session history | Preserved | Preserved |
| Transcripts | Preserved | Preserved |
| Analytics data | Preserved | Preserved |
| Knowledge base links | Unlinked | Unlinked |
| Function associations | Unlinked | Unlinked |

<Info>
  Knowledge bases and functions are **not** deleted when you delete an agent. They remain available for other agents.
</Info>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Check for active sessions first">
    Before deleting a deployed agent, check for active sessions:

    ```javascript
    const { data: sessions } = await vora.sessions.list({
      agent_id: agentId,
      status: 'active'
    });

    if (sessions.length > 0) {
      console.log(`Warning: ${sessions.length} active sessions`);
      // Wait or force delete
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Archive instead of delete">
    For agents you might need later, consider creating an archive:

    ```javascript
    async function archiveAgent(agentId) {
      // Get full agent configuration
      const agent = await vora.agents.get(agentId);

      // Save to your storage
      await saveToArchive({
        originalId: agent.id,
        config: agent.config,
        knowledgeBases: agent.knowledge_bases,
        functions: agent.functions,
        archivedAt: new Date().toISOString()
      });

      // Then delete
      await vora.agents.delete(agentId);
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use soft delete in production">
    Always use soft delete (the default) in production environments. This allows recovery from accidental deletions.

    ```javascript
    // ✅ Good - soft delete
    await vora.agents.delete(agentId);

    // ⚠️ Caution - only for cleanup
    await vora.agents.delete(agentId, { permanent: true });
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Codes

| Code | Description | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `NOT_FOUND` | Agent doesn't exist | Verify agent ID |
| `CONFLICT` | Active sessions exist | Wait for sessions or use force |
| `ALREADY_DELETED` | Agent already deleted | Use restore to recover |
