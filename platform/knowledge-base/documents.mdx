## Processing Pipeline

Each document goes through these stages:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[Upload] --> E[Extract Text]
    E --> C[Chunk Content]
    C --> V[Generate Vectors]
    V --> I[Index]

    style I fill:#10b981,color:#fff
```

### 1. Text Extraction

Content is extracted based on file type:

- **PDF**: Text layer extracted; OCR for scanned documents (Enterprise)
- **Word**: Full text including tables and lists
- **Markdown/HTML**: Content extracted, formatting preserved where useful
- **CSV**: Headers become metadata, rows become chunks

### 2. Chunking

Content is split into chunks for retrieval:

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Paragraph** | Split on double newlines | General documents |
| **Sentence** | Split on sentence boundaries | Dense technical content |
| **Fixed size** | Split at character count | Consistent chunk sizes |
| **Semantic** | Split by topic changes | Long-form content |

### 3. Embedding

Each chunk is converted to a vector:

```javascript
// Example chunk
{
  "content": "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days...",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "policies.pdf",
    "page": 5,
    "section": "Returns"
  },
  "vector": [0.023, -0.145, 0.892, ...] // 1536 dimensions
}
```

### 4. Indexing

Vectors are indexed for fast retrieval:

- Approximate nearest neighbor search
- Sub-second query times
- Scales to millions of chunks

## Document Settings

### Per-Document Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Title** | Display name | Filename |
| **Category** | Folder for organization | Root |
| **Priority** | Weight in search results | Normal |
| **Enabled** | Include in retrieval | Yes |

### Metadata

Add custom metadata to documents:

```json
{
  "product": "Widget Pro",
  "version": "2.0",
  "department": "Support",
  "last_review": "2024-01-15"
}
```

Use metadata for:
- Filtering results by product or category
- Adding context to retrieved chunks
- Tracking content freshness

## Managing Documents

### Viewing Documents

Go to **Knowledge Base** → **Sources** → **Documents** to see:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | Document title |
| **Status** | Processing status |
| **Chunks** | Number of chunks created |
| **Size** | File size |
| **Added** | Upload date |

### Document Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Processing** | Being extracted and indexed |
| **Ready** | Available for retrieval |
| **Error** | Processing failed |
| **Updating** | Being reprocessed |

### Updating Documents

To update a document's content:

1. Click the document → **Replace**
2. Upload the new version
3. Wait for reprocessing

<Note>
  Replacing a document maintains its ID and metadata. Chunks are regenerated.
</Note>

### Deleting Documents

1. Select one or more documents
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm deletion

<Warning>
  Deleted documents are removed from the index immediately. Agents will no longer retrieve this content.
</Warning>

## Bulk Operations

### Bulk Upload

Upload many documents at once:

1. Create a ZIP file with your documents
2. Upload the ZIP file
3. Documents are extracted and processed individually

### Folder Structure

ZIP folder structure becomes categories:

```
policies.zip
├── Returns/
│   ├── standard-returns.pdf
│   └── warranty-returns.pdf
├── Shipping/
│   ├── domestic.pdf
│   └── international.pdf
└── general-faq.pdf
```

### Via API

```javascript
// Upload document via API
const document = await vora.knowledgeBase.documents.create(
  'kb_abc123',
  {
    file: fileBuffer,
    filename: 'product-manual.pdf',
    metadata: {
      product: 'Widget Pro',
      version: '2.0',
    },
  }
);

console.log(`Document created: ${document.id}`);
console.log(`Chunks: ${document.chunkCount}`);
```

## Chunk Preview

View how a document was chunked:

1. Click on the document
2. Go to **Chunks** tab
3. See all chunks with:
   - Content preview
   - Metadata
   - Page/section info

### Example Chunks

| # | Content Preview | Page | Section |
|---|-----------------|------|---------|
| 1 | "Welcome to Widget Pro. This manual covers..." | 1 | Introduction |
| 2 | "To set up your Widget Pro, first ensure..." | 2 | Setup |
| 3 | "The power button is located on the top..." | 2 | Setup |
| 4 | "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days..." | 10 | Policies |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive filenames">
    `product-manual-widget-pro-v2.pdf` is better than `manual.pdf`. Filenames become metadata.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep documents focused">
    Split large documents by topic. A 100-page document about everything is harder to retrieve from than 10 focused documents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Include context">
    Documents should be self-contained. Include product names and context that helps the agent understand what the content is about.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update outdated content">
    Regularly review and update documents. Old information leads to incorrect answers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent formatting">
    Clear headings and structure help chunking algorithms split content appropriately.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Document Processing Failed

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Extraction failed** | Corrupt file | Re-export the document |
| **No text found** | Scanned PDF without OCR | Enable OCR (Enterprise) or use text-based PDF |
| **File too large** | Exceeds size limit | Split into smaller documents |
| **Unsupported format** | Format not supported | Convert to supported format |

### Poor Chunk Quality

- **Chunks too short**: Increase chunk size
- **Chunks too long**: Decrease chunk size or change splitting strategy
- **Missing content**: Check document for encoding issues

## Limits

| Limit | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
|-------|------|-----|------------|
| **Max file size** | 10 MB | 50 MB | 200 MB |
| **Files per KB** | 10 | 100 | Unlimited |
| **Total storage** | 50 MB | 1 GB | Unlimited |
| **OCR** | No | No | Yes |
